When humans look at a scene, they usually focus on their interested parts in a special priority. This innate habit indicates a hierarchical preference about human perception. Therefore, we argue to generate the Scene Graph of Interest which should be hierarchically constructed, so that the important primary content is firstly presented while the secondary one is presented on demand. To achieve this goal, we propose the Tree–Guided Importance Ranking (TGIR) model. We represent the scene with a hierarchical structure by firstly detecting objects in the scene and organizing them into a Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) according to their spatial scale, considering that larger objects are more likely to be noticed instantly.","tags":[],"title":"Importance First: Generating Scene Graph of Human Interest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbin Wang","Ruiping Wang","Xilin Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658102400,"objectID":"56291b551bbd69c0ea647655ffff1a3b","permalink":"https://kennethwong.tech/publication/ssi22/","publishdate":"2022-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ssi22/","section":"publication","summary":"Scene graph generation has been a popular topic in recent years. However, it has suffered from the bias brought by the long-tailed distribution among the relationships. The scene graph generator prefers to predict the head predicates which are ambiguous and less precise. It makes the scene graph convey less information and degenerate into the stacking of objects, which restricts other applications from reasoning on the graph. In order to make the generator predict more diverse relationships and give a precise scene graph, we propose a method called Additional Biased Predictor (ABP) assisted balanced learning.","tags":[],"title":"Balanced Scene Graph Generation Assisted by Additional Biased Predictor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbin Wang","Ruiping Wang","Xilin Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626998400,"objectID":"0ba9b90b96401f20f9ab8287d0fdecbe","permalink":"https://kennethwong.tech/publication/iccv21/","publishdate":"2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iccv21/","section":"publication","summary":"If an image tells a story, the scene graph and image caption are the most popular narrators. Generally, a scene graph prefers to be an omniscient generalist, while the image caption is more willing to be a specialist, which outlines the gist. Lots of previous studies have found that as a generalist, a scene graph is not enough to serve for downstream advanced intelligent tasks unless it can reduce the trivial contents and noises. In this respect, the image caption is a good teacher. To this end, we let the scene graph borrow the ability from the image caption.","tags":[],"title":"Topic Scene Graph Generation by Attention Distillation from Caption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kenneth Wong"],"categories":["Deep Learning"],"content":"TBD.

To alleviate this problem, we treat relationship as an abstract object, exploring not only significative visual pattern but contextual information for it, which are two key aspects when considering object recognition. Our observation on current datasets reveals that there exists intimate association among relationships. Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Context and Visual Pattern of Relationship for Scene Graph Generation","type":"publication"}]
