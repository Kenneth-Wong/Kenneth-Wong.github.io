When humans analyze a scene, they usually prefer to describe image gist ﬁrst, namely major objects and key relations in a scene graph, which contains essential image content. This humans’ inherent perceptive habit implies that there exists a hierarchical structure about humans’ preference during the scene parsing procedure. Therefore, we argue that a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph.","tags":[],"title":"Sketching Image Gist: Human-Mimetic Hierarchical Scene Graph Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbin Wang","Ruiping Wang","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560528000,"objectID":"0d881aff7de213360ec4a2d5e0ea69ee","permalink":"https://kennethwong.tech/publication/cvpr19/","publishdate":"2019-06-15T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cvpr19/","section":"publication","summary":"Relationship is the core of scene graph, but its prediction is far from satisfying because of its complex visual diversity. To alleviate this problem, we treat relationship as an abstract object, exploring not only significative visual pattern but contextual information for it, which are two key aspects when considering object recognition. Our observation on current datasets reveals that there exists intimate association among relationships. Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Context and Visual Pattern of Relationship for Scene Graph Generation","type":"publication"}]
